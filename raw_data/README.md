# 8-18_9-18.sav

carly: I’ve attached a portion of the newest dataset, specifically one month of
data from August 18th to September 18th. This file includes Districts 2, 11, and
7, as well as the new IsChin variable. For reference, the IsChin variable is
coded as true/false, where true indicates there was an impact on traffic flow,
and false indicates there was not.

richard: As you may recall, one of the things we were waiting on was some
additional data that could tell us if a work zone was likely to interfere with
traffic flow (roadway repair) vs. not (e.g., brush clearing on the side of the
road). We were finally able to obtain an IsChin dataset from CalTrans that
includes a variable providing this information.

We plan to use this variable, combined with the Work Zone Type variable, to
restrict our analyzes to work zones where the in-cab alert had greater potential
to impact driver behavior. We are hoping that by eliminating the work zones that
had no impact on traffic flow, we will be able to see a stronger signal in the
alerted vehicles.

Sarah, Carly and I are moving ahead with our statistical analyses, which will
include the IsChin data. I wanted to let you know about this development to see
if you are interested in continuing to examine the driving patterns that you so
eloquently produced with your dashboard and add the IsChin data. If you’re too
busy, we totally understand and appreciate all you’ve done to help us understand
what the data “look” like. We also wanted to let you know that if you know a
student who would like to work with the data to further explore driving patterns
and how to interpret them, we are happy to work with them.

carly: I attached a new data set which is our most recent data set that
incorporates both the control data fix as well as the changed alert distance.

# 1-7_2-18Data3.5milesapart 1.sav

I attached a data set from dates 1/7-2/18 with only work zones that are 3.5
miles apart from any other work zone (instead of 5 miles since there weren't
very many). This data set also has the "isCHINSreportable" field, which is
labeled as Column1.ref_id in the data set.

# 11-23-12-23Cleaned_5.sav

entire dataset with all work zones, might have some issues with workzones that
are close together
