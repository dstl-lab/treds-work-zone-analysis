# 3-31_4-16_DataAfterControlFixandAlertDistanceChange.sav

carly: I attached a new data set which is our most recent data set that
incorporates both the control data fix as well as the changed alert distance.

# 1-7_2-18Data3.5milesapart 1.sav

I attached a data set from dates 1/7-2/18 with only work zones that are 3.5
miles apart from any other work zone (instead of 5 miles since there weren't
very many). This data set also has the "isCHINSreportable" field, which is
labeled as Column1.ref_id in the data set.

# 11-23-12-23Cleaned_5.sav

entire dataset with all work zones, might have some issues with workzones that
are close together
